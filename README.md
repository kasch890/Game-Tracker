# Game Tracking Log
This application prompts the user to enter information about video games (or any game) that they have played and would like to keep track of. Users can input game name, rating, whether they watched or played it and the console it was played on, and comments about what things stuck out to them about the game. This is useful for avid gamers that use multiple platforms, aspiring game developers that want to keep track of things that they might like to apply to their own games, and streamers that would like to keep track of games that they've already played. 

## Installation
To install, simply download the Game_Log.py and Game.py files and have them in the same folder. This folder will also be the location of the output .json file.

## Run the program
Once you have downloaded, run the Game_Log.py file and follow the console's prompts! make sure you import existing game_log data if you are returning to the application and the export your changes before exiting the program!
